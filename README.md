This is an example of how the landing page looks like below:
https://exampleoflandingpages.netlify.app/

You can use this landing page for free, I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript only, it should be very easy for you to host it and deploy it. Remember you can change the text and image yourself it should be pretty easy.
